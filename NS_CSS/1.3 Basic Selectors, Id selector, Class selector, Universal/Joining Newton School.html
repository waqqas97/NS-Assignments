<!-- Joining Newton School

Create a div with id="motive", inside it write the text
"We are joining" followed by a span tag with class="ns"
and text "Newton School" inside it.

So the rendered output should be "We are joining Newton School".

For styling, give #motive element padding of 10px and background-color 'black' and a font color 'white'.
span with class 'ns' will have background-color as 'red'.
