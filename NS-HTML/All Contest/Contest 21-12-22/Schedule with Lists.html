<!-- Schedule with Lists
You are tired of not being able to do your tasks on time so this time you decided to make a list of all the tasks you want to do in a day.
Using HTML Lists you decided to make 3 lists, each of a different type , one ordered list, one unordered List, and one descriptive list

In Ordered List

its id is #ordered-parent
list items will be numbered with uppercase letters
It has four items named get up in the morning, shopping, Newton School Assignment, Dinner
The item named shopping contains an ordered list having id #ordered-child. Its items will be numbered with lowercase letters and it contains two items groceries, Drinks.



In Unordered List

its id is #unordered-parent
It contains three items Coffee, Fruits, Milk
The item Fruits contain an unordered List having id #unordered-chid and it contains items Banana, Pineapple


In Descriptive List

its id is #descriptive-list
It contains the description term Black Drink which has description data Coca Cola and Pepsi
It contains the description term Orange Drink which has description data which is Mirinda, Fanta



An image is also attached at bottom of the question showing how the Lists will look after coding, just increase the question text window size to see the data.
